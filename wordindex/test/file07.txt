Researchers Detail How A Distant Black Hole Devoured A Star 08.24.11 WASHINGTON Two studies appearing in the Aug 25 issue of the journal Nature provide new insights into a cosmic accident that has been streaming X-rays toward Earth since late March NASAs Swift satellite first alerted astronomers to intense and unusual high-energy flares from the new source in the constellation Draco Incredibly this source is still producing X-rays and may remain bright enough for Swift to observe into next year said David Burrows professor of astronomy at Penn State University and lead scientist for the missions X-Ray Telescope instrument It behaves unlike anything weve seen before Astronomers soon realized the source known as Swift J1644+57 was the result of a truly extraordinary event the awakening of a distant galaxys dormant black hole as it shredded and consumed a star The galaxy is so far away it took the light from the event approximately 3.9 billion years to reach Earth Burrows study included NASA scientists It highlights the X- and gamma-ray observations from Swift and other detectors including the Japan-led Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image MAXI instrument aboard the International Space Station The second study was led by Ashley Zauderer a post-doctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge Mass It examines the unprecedented outburst through observations from numerous ground-based radio observatories including the National Radio Astronomy Observatorys Expanded Very Large Array EVLA near Socorro N.M Most galaxies including our own possess a central supersized black hole weighing millions of times the suns mass According to the new studies the black hole in the galaxy hosting Swift J1644+57 may be twice the mass of the four-million-solar-mass black hole in the center of the Milky Way galaxy As a star falls toward a black hole it is ripped apart by intense tides The gas is corralled into a disk that swirls around the black hole and becomes rapidly heated to temperatures of millions of degrees The innermost gas in the disk spirals toward the black hole where rapid motion and magnetism create dual oppositely directed funnels through which some particles may escape Jets driving matter at velocities greater than 90 percent the speed of light form along the black holes spin axis In the case of Swift J1644+57 one of these jets happened to point straight at Earth The radio emission occurs when the outgoing jet slams into the interstellar environment Zauderer explained By contrast the X-rays arise much closer to the black hole likely near the base of the jet Theoretical studies of tidally disrupted stars suggested they would appear as flares at optical and ultraviolet energies The brightness and energy of a black holes jet is greatly enhanced when viewed head-on The phenomenon called relativistic beaming explains why Swift J1644+57 was seen at X-ray energies and appeared so strikingly luminous When first detected March 28 the flares were initially assumed to signal a gamma-ray burst one of the nearly daily short blasts of high-energy radiation often associated with the death of a massive star and the birth of a black hole in the distant universe But as the emission continued to brighten and flare astronomers realized that the most plausible explanation was the tidal disruption of a sun-like star seen as beamed emission By March 30 EVLA observations by Zauderers team showed a brightening radio source centered on a faint galaxy near Swifts position for the X-ray flares These data provided the first conclusive evidence that the galaxy the radio source and the Swift event were linked Our observations show that the radio-emitting region is still expanding at more than half the speed of light said Edo Berger an associate professor of astrophysics at Harvard and a coauthor of the radio paper By tracking this expansion backward in time we can confirm that the outflow formed at the same time as the Swift X-ray source Swift launched in November 2004 is managed by NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Md It is operated in collaboration with Penn State the Los Alamos National Laboratory in N.M and Orbital Sciences Corp in Dulles Va with international collaborators in the U.K. Italy Germany and Japan MAXI is operated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency as an external experiment attached to the Kibo module of the space station
