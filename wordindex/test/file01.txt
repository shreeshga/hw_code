Next NASA Earth-Observing Satellite Arrives in California for Launch 08.31.11 NASAs NPP mission will continue collecting critical climate data to help scientist unravel the mysteries of climate change NPP is carrying five instruments on board The biggest and most important instrument is The Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite or VIIRS This video focuses on VIIRS and why it is so important to Earths science On Tuesday Aug 30 NASAs next earth-observing research satellite arrived at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to begin preparations for an October launch The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Preparatory Project NPP is the first of a new generation of satellites that will observe many facets of our changing Earth long-term climate change and short-term weather conditions With NPP NASA continues many key data records initiated by the agencys Earth Observing System satellites by monitoring changes occurring in the atmosphere oceans vegetation ice and solid Earth On Aug 28 NPP was placed in a shipping container and loaded on a transport truck at Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp in Boulder Colo After Tuesdays arrival the satellite was unloaded and moved into the clean room at the AstroTech facility for launch preparation The NPP team has produced an outstanding satellite and kept to schedule over the past year and a half said Ken Schwer NPP project manager at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Md The world is looking forward to NPPs scientific measurements The NPP spacecraft will undergo prelaunch processing at Vandenberg including a solar array functional test a spacecraft limited performance test and testing of the science instruments Following these tests and a spacecraft launch simulation the satellite will be fueled with its attitude control propellant NPP will be launched on a United Launch Alliance Delta II 7920 expendable launch vehicle The Delta II first stage was hoisted into position on the pad at NASAs Space Launch Complex 2 on July 20 By Aug 2 the nine solid rocket boosters were attached and the second stage was hoisted atop the first stage Launch vehicle testing is under way The NPP spacecraft is scheduled to move to the pad and be mated with the rocket on Oct 7 Launch is scheduled for Oct 25 during a 9-minute and 10-second launch window from 5:48:01 to 5:57:11 a.m. EDT The Delta II will place the satellite into a 512-mile high circular polar orbit NPP is the first satellite mission to address the challenge of acquiring a wide range of land ocean and atmospheric measurements for Earth system science while simultaneously preparing to address operational requirements for weather forecasting NPP serves as a bridge between NASAs Earth Observing System of satellites and the forthcoming Joint Polar Satellite System JPSS Previously called the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System JPSS satellites will be developed by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA NPP will carry five science instruments and test key technologies for the JPSS missions Data from NPP will help scientists ensure a continuous record of environmental satellite data and also contribute to weather forecasting efforts NOAA meteorologists will incorporate NPP data into their weather prediction models to produce accurate forecasts and warnings that will help emergency responders monitor and react to natural disasters
