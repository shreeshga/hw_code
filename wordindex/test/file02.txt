NASAs Mars Rover Opportunity Begins Study of Martian Crater 09.01.11 PASADENA Calif The initial work of NASAs Mars rover Opportunity at its new location on Mars shows surface compositional differences from anything the robot has studied in its first 7.5 years of exploration Opportunity arrived three weeks ago at the rim of a 14-mile-wide 22-kilometer-wide crater named Endeavour The first rock it examined is flat-topped and about the size of a footstool It was apparently excavated by an impact that dug a crater the size of a tennis court into the craters rim The rock was informally named Tisdale 2 This is different from any rock ever seen on Mars said Steve Squyres principal investigator for Opportunity at Cornell University in Ithaca N.Y. It has a composition similar to some volcanic rocks but theres much more zinc and bromine than weve typically seen We are getting confirmation that reaching Endeavour really has given us the equivalent of a second landing site for Opportunity The diversity of fragments in Tisdale 2 could be a prelude to other minerals Opportunity might find at Endeavour In the past two weeks researchers have used an instrument on the rovers robotic arm to identify elements at several spots on Tisdale 2 Scientists have also examined the rock using the rovers microscopic imager and multiple filters of its panoramic camera Observations by Mars orbiters suggest that rock exposures on Endeavours rim date from early in Martian history and include clay minerals that form in less-acidic wet conditions possibly more favorable for life Discontinuous ridges are all that remains of the ancient craters rim The ridge at the section of the rim where Opportunity arrived is named Cape York A gap between Cape York and the next rim fragment to the south is called Botany Bay On the final traverses to Cape York we saw ragged outcrops at Botany Bay unlike anything Opportunity has seen so far and a bench around the edge of Cape York looks like sedimentary rock thats been cut and filled with veins of material possibly delivered by water said Ray Arvidson the rovers deputy principal investigator at Washington University in St Louis We made an explicit decision to examine ancient rocks of Cape York first The science team selected Endeavour as Opportunitys long-term destination after the rover climbed out of Victoria crater three years ago this week The mission spent two years studying Victoria which is about one twenty-fifth as wide as Endeavour Layers of bedrock exposed at Victoria and other locations Opportunity has visited share a sulfate-rich composition linked to an ancient era when acidic water was present Opportunity drove about 13 miles 21 kilometers from Victoria to reach Endeavour It has driven 20.8 miles 33.5 kilometers since landing on Mars We have a very senior rover in good health for having already worked 30 times longer than planned said John Callas project manager for Opportunity at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena Calif However at any time we could lose a critical component on an essential rover system and the mission would be over Or we might still be using this rovers capabilities beneficially for years There are miles of exciting geology to explore at Endeavour crater Opportunity and its rover twin Spirit completed three-month prime missions in April 2004 and continued working for years of extended missions Both have made important discoveries about wet environments on ancient Mars that may have been favorable for supporting microbial life Spirit ended communications in March 2010 This is like having a brand new landing site for our veteran rover said Dave Lavery program executive for NASAs Mars Exploration Rovers at NASA Headquarters in Washington It is a remarkable bonus that comes from being able to rove on Mars with well-built hardware that lasts
