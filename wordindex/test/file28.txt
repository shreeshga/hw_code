Why companies test phones in the wild SEPTEMBER 1 2011 5:39 PM PDT As CNET reported yesterday a second unreleased Apple iPhone has gone astray The secret device was lost at a San Francisco bar in late July CNET reporters Declan McCullagh and Greg Sandoval wrote and Apple quickly conducted an aggressive campaign to find it If it sounds familiar thats because it is Remember that last year an Apple computer engineer accidentally left a prototype iPhone 4 in a German beer garden in Redwood City Calif And just today the two men who allegedly sold the device to tech blog Gizmodo pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges at an arraignment If youre surprised that it could happen again we dont blame you Nor do we blame you for wondering why an Apple employee would even have an unreleased device out in the wild at all On the surface it does sound crazy but Apple not to mention wireless carriers and other handset manufacturers have good reasons for doing so Heres why Even with the risks involved Apple cant reliably test a new cell phone without a few devices leaving the companys Cupertino Calif headquarters Keeping the handsets under lock and key may sound safer and it no doubt would be but Apple can do only so much in one place It can test the media player it can capture photos with the camera and it can evaluate the general performance of iOS in an office or lab but it cant fully evaluate the phones most critical features like call quality the strength of the cellular connection for both voice data data and the GPS connection As I explained after I visited Sprints testing labs in Overland Park Kan in July testing a phones antenna and cellular connection involves two parts First the device is tested inside a sophisticated RF radiofrequency chamber to ensure that its antenna can connect to a carriers network that it operates properly on the network and that it doesnt interfere with a carriers other handsets The chamber itself is designed to block out all external signals so that technicians can get a pure result Like Sprint Apple has such a chamber at its headquarters which it showed to a select group of journalists last year Later additional tests are performed in other specially designed rooms to check the sound clarity and quality All the data from the above tests is then analyzed and collected And if problems arise designers and engineers address them But as useful as the information can be tests that simulate real-world usage conditions are equally important For example engineers have to evaluate how the phone performs in environments where other signals from radio signals to Wi-Fi to other cell phones are present Sure you could find such a place in the middle of Apples cafeteria at lunchtime but its a safe bet that Apples entire campus is wired for great cell phone coverage So the test wouldnt be very fair As a result companies like Apple need to find those areas where coverage isnt fantastic and collect more data Is the phone pinging the tower correctly How is the hand-off between different towers and different networks EDGE 3G etc Is it putting an unusual strain on the network Is it sending and receiving voice and data properly What are the data speeds and voice quality Is it suffering from any interference or static All of these questions need answers Whats more even without other wireless equipment around engineers need to evaluate the phones performance in areas that just have a poor signal quality Though engineers can mimic poor strength in a lab they also collect performance data from real places where real people use the phone Finally real-world locations are important to test features like Bluetooth GPS signal strength and accuracy and the hundreds of apps that interact with both features Here again that information isnt reliable if you only collect it in one place So Apple has to gather a range of locations from a conference room in Cupertino to a bar in San Francisco
