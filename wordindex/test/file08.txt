NASAS Wise Mission Discovers Coolest Class of Stars08.23.11 PASADENA Calif - Scientists using data from NASAs Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer WISE have discovered the coldest class of star-like bodies with temperatures as cool as the human body Astronomers hunted these dark orbs termed Y dwarfs for more than a decade without success When viewed with a visible-light telescope they are nearly impossible to see WISEs infrared vision allowed the telescope to finally spot the faint glow of six Y dwarfs relatively close to our sun within a distance of about 40 light-years WISE scanned the entire sky for these and other objects and was able to spot their feeble light with its highly sensitive infrared vision said Jon Morse Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters in Washington They are 5000 times brighter at the longer infrared wavelengths WISE observed from space than those observable from the ground The Ys are the coldest members of the brown dwarf family Brown dwarfs are sometimes referred to as failed stars They are too low in mass to fuse atoms at their cores and thus dont burn with the fires that keep stars like our sun shining steadily for billions of years Instead these objects cool and fade with time until what little light they do emit is at infrared wavelengths Astronomers study brown dwarfs to better understand how stars form and to understand the atmospheres of planets beyond our solar system The atmospheres of brown dwarfs are similar to those of gas-giant planets like Jupiter but they are easier to observe because they are alone in space away from the blinding light of a parent star So far WISE data have revealed 100 new brown dwarfs More discoveries are expected as scientists continue to examine the enormous quantity of data from WISE The telescope performed the most advanced survey of the sky at infrared wavelengths to date from Jan 2010 to Feb 2011 scanning the entire sky about 1.5 times Of the 100 brown dwarfs six are classified as cool Ys One of the Y dwarfs called WISE 1828+2650 is the record holder for the coldest brown dwarf with an estimated atmospheric temperature cooler than room temperature or less than about 80 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees Celsius The brown dwarfs we were turning up before this discovery were more like the temperature of your oven said Davy Kirkpatrick a WISE science team member at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena Calif With the discovery of Y dwarfs weve moved out of the kitchen and into the cooler parts of the house Kirkpatrick is lead author of a paper appearing in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series describing the 100 confirmed brown dwarfs Michael Cushing a WISE team member at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena Calif is lead author of a paper describing the Y dwarfs in the Astrophysical Journal The Y dwarfs are in our suns neighborhood from approximately nine to 40 light-years away The Y dwarf approximately nine light-years away WISE 1541-2250 may become the seventh closest star system bumping Ross 154 back to eighth By comparison the star closest to our solar system Proxima Centauri is about four light-years away Finding brown dwarfs near our sun is like discovering theres a hidden house on your block that you didnt know about Cushing said Its thrilling to me to know weve got neighbors out there yet to be discovered With WISE we may even find a brown dwarf closer to us than our closest known star Once the WISE team identified brown dwarf candidates they turned to NASAs Spitzer Space Telescope to narrow their list To definitively confirm them the WISE team used some of the most powerful telescopes on Earth to split apart the objects light and look for telltale molecular signatures of water methane and possibly ammonia For the very coldest of the new Y dwarfs the team used NASAs Hubble Space Telescope The Y dwarfs were identified based on a change in these spectral features compared to other brown dwarfs indicating they have a lower atmospheric temperature The ground-based telescopes used in these studies include the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility atop Mauna Kea Hawaii Caltechs Palomar Observatory near San Diego the W.M Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea Hawaii and the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory Chile among others
