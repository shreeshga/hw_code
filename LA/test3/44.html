          History of the John Henrik Clarke Africana Library</h2> 
 

    
     

        <p><font size="2">Reprinted from: <em>Black Caucus of the ALA Newsletter</em>, 
        vol. XXIV, No. 5 (April, 1996), p. 11.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The John Henrik Clarke Africana Library is a special 
          library located within Cornell University's Africana Studies and Research 
          Center. The library is one of nineteen units of the University Library 
          system, and offers a full range of services. Its collection of [21,100] 
          volumes focuses on the social and political dimensions of the history 
          and culture of peoples of African ancestry. It supports the curriculum 
          of the Africana Studies and Research Center and sustained, independent 
          study. Included here are basic books, complete collections of works 
          of important writers, and highly selective research materials that complement 
          the collections housed in Cornell University's research libraries. The 
          Africana Library's documentation collection contains valuable primary 
          source materials, including copies of rare monographs, manuscripts, 
          newspapers, and journal publications on microfilm and microfiche. Those 
          resources focus on especially important material on the American civil 
          rights and Black Power movements.</font> <font size="2"><br>
          <br>
          The Africana Center was founded in 1969 following black student protests 
          on the Cornell Campus. One notable event involved black students depositing 
          hundreds of books at the undergraduate library circulation desk and 
          denouncing them as irrelevant to their experiences. Historically, the 
          faculty of the Africana Studies and Research Center has always had a 
          strong commitment towards maintaining its own library. The Africana 
          Center included a library when it was first established. Later, after 
          its building was destroyed by arsonists (April 1, 1970), it garnered 
          funds from the university and local community to replace materials lost 
          from its library collection. Once it relocated to its present site the 
          library was prominently established near the building's entrance.<br>
          <br>
          In the late 1970s there was heated debate on campus about relocating 
          the Africana Center once more. Because it's location was some distance 
          away from central campus (approximately 20 minutes walking time) and 
          many of its courses were taught at the Center, some considered the Africana 
          Studies program too segregated. A number of more central locations were 
          proposed for relocation. In the end these were rejected because they 
          entailed substantial reductions in space. Ultimately, the Center's fledgling 
          library benefited from this consequence. A reduction in space would 
          have affected collection size and overall growth.<br>
          <br>
          During 1984-85 the Africana Center and University Library reached an 
          agreement to transfer the library administratively to the University 
          Library. Faculty of the Africana Studies &amp; Research Center named 
            the library in honor of Dr. John Henrik Clarke during the summer of 
            1985. As a distinguished historian, Dr. Clarke was instrumental in establishing 
            the Africana Center's curriculum in the 1970s and taught courses in 
            black history at Cornell. Several years later, in 1990, the Africana 
            Center and University Library collaborated to raise $50,000 to renovate 
            the library's space and enhance the overall level of service. The John 
            Henrik Clarke Africana Library now occupies most of the lower level 
            of the Africana Center's three-story building. A third of this space 
            is shared with a graduate student lounge and a computer lab. All of 
            the library's holdings are included in the University Library's online 
            catalog, and the Africana Library itself houses several online catalog 
            terminals, a circulation terminal, CD-ROM and various audio-visual equipment, 
            and has access to numerous locally networked bibliographic databases.*</font></p>
