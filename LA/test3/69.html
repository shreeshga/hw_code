        <p>The original essays in this book highlight the destructive  impact of McCarthyism on the African American Freedom Movement. Recovering  little-known stories of black radical activism, they challenge the idea that  the Cold War was, on balance, beneficial to the movement. The book emphasizes  what was lost when anticommunism forced the movement to submerge broader issues  of economic justice, labor rights, feminism, and peace. The authors illustrate  the often neglected or understated human costs of the Red Scare, focusing on  local and individual stories that offer insight into larger national and  international trends.

        <p>Wangari Maathai, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and founder of  the Green Belt Movement, offers a refreshingly unique perspective on the  challenges facing Africa, even as she calls for a moral  revolution among Africans themselves, who, she argues, are culturally deracinated,  adrift between worlds. The troubles of Africa today are  severe and wide-ranging. Yet what we see of them in the media, more often than  not, are tableaux vivantes connoting poverty, dependence, and desperation.  Wangari Maathai presents a different vision, informed by her three decades as  an environmental activist and campaigner for democracy. She illuminates the  complex and dynamic nature of the continent, and offers hardheaded hope and  realistic options for change and improvement. (Bowker&rsquo;s Books in Print)</p>

        <p>Award-winning journalist Alec Russell was in South    Africa to witness the fall of apartheid and  the remarkable reconciliation of Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s rule; and returned in  2007-2008 to see Mandela&rsquo;s successor, Thabo Mbeki, fritter away the country&rsquo;s  reputation. South Africa is now perched on a precipice, as it prepares to elect  Jacob Zuma as president signaling a potential slide back to the bad old days of  post-colonial African leadership, and disaster for a country that was once the  beacon of the continent. Drawing on his long relationships with all the key  senior figures including Mandela, Mbeki, Desmond Tutu, and Zuma, and a host of  South Africans he has known over the years including former activists turned  billionaires and reactionary Boers Alec Russell&rsquo;s <em>Bring Me My Machine Gun</em> is a beautifully told and expertly  researched account of South Africa&rsquo;s great tragedy: the tragedy of hope  unfulfilled.

        <p>Satu Riutta asks whether civic education initiatives to  which huge sums of donor funds and effort are devoted annually actually promote  political participation among the rural poor in nascent democracies. Does  raising awareness about citizen rights and responsibilities increase  participation? Are the effects of civic education greatest on collective or  individual forms of participation? Do women respond differently than men?  Drawing on a rich set of original data from villages in Tanzania  and Zambia,  Riutta casts new light on both the empowering effects and the limitations of  civic education in the context of participatory development and  democratization.

        <p>Writer Mat Johnson (Hell Blazer: Papa Midnight), winner of  the prestigious Hurston-Wright Legacy Award for fiction, constructs a fearless  graphic novel that is both a page-turning mystery and a disturbing exploration  of race and self-image in America, masterfully illustrated with rich period  detail by Warren Pleece (The Invisibles, Hell Blazer). In the early 20th  Century, when lynchings were commonplace throughout the American South, a few  courageous reporters from the North risked their lives to expose these  atrocities. They were African-American men who, due to their light skin color,  could pass among the white folks. They called this dangerous assignment going  incognegro. Zane Pinchback, a reporter for the New York-based New Holland  Herald, barely escapes with his life after his latest incognegro story goes  bad. But when he returns to the sanctuary of Harlem, he&rsquo;s  sent to investigate the arrest of his own brother, charged with the brutal  murder of a white woman in Mississippi.

        <p>The systematic study of the Africana/Black experience  emerged in universities in the USA  in the late 1960s. As an outgrowth of the Civil Rights and Black Conscious  movements, demonstrations occurred on campuses nationwide, giving birth to the  new academic discipline. Written by emerging and established scholars and  published in the Western Journal of Black Studies over a span of three decades  beginning in 1977, the 27 essays included in Africana Studies provide an  evolutionary trajectory of the discipline, including theoretical, ideological,  and methodological perspectives and paradigms. The primary focus is the African  American experience with emphasis on how the theoretical and methodological  approaches have changed over time as the discipline matured. Topics include  pre-colonial literacy and scholarship in West Africa,  Black Nationalism, intellectual foundations of racism, and the ideology of  European dominance.

        <p>Oral and Written Expressions of African Cultures challenges  the traditional view of exotic and atavistic Africa with  a balanced examination of the continent's realities and challenges. It shows  how oral and written expressions capture the complexity, concerns, dynamism,  challenges and ingenuity of African masses. It brings together twelve scholars  from different academic backgrounds that draw from the rich repertoire of  music, poetry, literature and the media in the continent to unearth the  underlying socio-cultural, economic and political factors that shape African  societies in the twenty first century.

        <p>Unlike most white Americans who, if they are so inclined,  can search their ancestral records, identifying who among their forebears was  the first to set foot on this country&rsquo;s shores, most African Americans, in  tracing their family&rsquo;s past, encounter a series of daunting obstacles. Slavery  was a brutally efficient nullifier of identity, willfully denying black men and  women even their names. Yet, from that legacy of slavery, there have sprung  generations whose struggled, thrived, and lived extraordinary lives. For too  long, African Americans family trees have been barren of branches, but, very  recently, advanced genetic testing techniques, combined with archival research,  have begun to fill in the gaps. Here, scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., backed by  an elite team of geneticists and researchers, takes nineteen extraordinary  African Americans on a once unimaginable journey, tracing family sagas through U.S.  history and back to Africa. Those whose recovered pasts  collectively form an African American peoples history of the United States  include celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Don  Cheadle, Chris Tucker, Morgan Freeman, Tina Turner, and Quincy Jones; writers  such as Maya Angelou and Bliss Broyard; leading thinkers such as Harvard  divinity professor Peter Gomes, the Reverend T. D. Jakes, neurosurgeon Ben  Carson, and sociologist Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot; and famous achievers such as  astronaut Mae Jemison, media personality Tom Joyner, decathlete Jackie  Joyner-Kersee, and Ebony and Jet publisher Linda Johnson Rice ( Bowker&rsquo;s Books  in Print)</p>

        <p>The Second Great Migration, the movement of African  Americans between the South and the North that began in the early 1940s and  tapered off in the late 1960s, transformed America.  This migration of approximately five million people helped improve the financial  prospects of black Americans, who, in the next generation, moved increasingly  into the middle class. Over seven years, Lisa Krissoff Boehm gathered oral  histories with women migrants and their children, two groups largely overlooked  in the story of this event. She also utilized existing oral histories with  migrants and southerners in leading archives. In extended excerpts from the  oral histories, and in thoughtful scholarly analysis of the voices, this book  offers a unique window into African American women&rsquo;s history. These rich oral  histories reveal much that is surprising. Although the Jim Crow South presented  persistent dangers, the women retained warm memories of southern childhoods.

        <p>In the midst of the atrocities reported in the Democratic  Republic of Congo, the seemingly constant strife in the Horn of Africa, and the  ongoing violence in Darfur, how do we make sense of the  simultaneous increase in interstate security cooperation in Africa?  To what extent, and why, does this cooperation differ from previous  initiatives? In what direction is it heading? Benedikt Franke assesses the  peace and security architecture that is taking shape under the nominal  leadership of the African Union, analyzing the emerging structures and trends  and also rethinking prevailing notions and theoretical assumptions about  interstate security relations.

        <p>This fascinating biography tells the story of  nineteenth-century America  through the life of one of its most magnetic and influential characters:  Sojourner Truth. In an in-depth account of this amazing activist, Margaret  Washington unravels Sojourner Truth's world within the broader panorama of  African American slavery and the nation's most significant reform era.  Organized chronologically into three distinct eras of Truth's life, Sojourner  Truth's America  examines the complex dynamics of the times in which she acted, beginning with  the transnational contours of her spirituality and early life as a slave. Washington  then highlights Truth's awakening during nineteenth-century America's  progressive surge, which propelled her ascendancy as a rousing preacher and  political orator despite her inability to read and write.

        <p>Award-winning civil rights historian Ray Arsenault describes  the dramatic story behind Marian Anderson&rsquo;s concert at the Lincoln Memorial an  early milestone in civil rights history on the seventieth anniversary of her  performance. On Easter Sunday 1939, the brilliant vocalist Marian Anderson sang  before a throng of seventy-five thousand at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington  an electrifying moment and an underappreciated milestone in civil rights  history. Though she was at the peak of a dazzling career, Anderson  had been barred from performing at the Daughters of the American Revolutions  Constitution Hall because she was black. When Eleanor Roosevelt resigned from  the DAR over the incident and took up Andersons  cause, however, it became a national issue. Like a female Jackie Robinson but  several years before his breakthrough Anderson  rose to a pressure-filled and politically charged occasion with dignity and  courage, and struck a vital blow for civil rights. In the 1963 March on Washington,  Martin Luther King would follow, literally, in Anderson&rsquo;s  footsteps. (Bowker&rsquo;s Books in Print)</p>

        <p>The crisis in Darfur has led to  systemic and widespread murder, rape, and abduction, as well as the forced  displacement of millions of civilians. It presents a defining moral challenge  to the world. The World and Darfur brings together  genocide scholars from a range of disciplines - social history, art history,  military history, African studies, media studies, literature, and political  science, sociology - to provide a cohesive and nuanced understanding of the  international response to the crisis in Western Sudan.  Contributing authors, including Eric Reeves, Frank Chalk, Eric Markusen, and  Samuel Totten, look at the lessons learned from the United Nations failure to  intervene during the Rwandan genocide, the representation of Darfur in the  mainstream media, atrocity investigations, activist and NGO campaigns, art  exhibitions and political rhetoric, and the role of the international community  in the discourse of genocide prevention and intervention.

        <p>With close to 20 million members, the Zulu are the largest  single ethnic group in all of Southern Africa. Their  culture is known all over the world. However, defining what lies at the core of  a Zulu identity remains a source of great controversy. What does it mean to be  Zulu, and therefore African, in today's world? Is being Zulu different now than  in the past? This comprehensive and wholly up-to-date reference wrestles with  these and many other questions. The book features a stunningly diverse group of  close to thirty contributors, universally acknowledged to be the world's  leading experts of Zulu culture and history. They discuss the characteristic  traditions of a pre-industrial people and how they evolved different cultural  expressions of &quot;Zulu-ness.&quot; They examine the legacies of Shaka, the  social and political intrigues of Zulu royalty, gender and generational  struggles, cultural and symbolic projections, and Zulu spirituality. The book  also highlights the debates raging in contemporary South    Africa over the manipulation of Zulu  heritage and whether it is being exploited for political purposes or for the  promotion of eco- and battlefield-tourism. In conclusion, the book contemplates  the future of Zulu identity in a unified South    Africa, a country that hopes to embrace the  forces of globalization. Truly comprehensive and authoritative, Zulu Identities  is the definitive volume on the Zulu people, history, and culture. (Bowker&rsquo;s  Books in Print)</p>
