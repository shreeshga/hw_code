      <div id="content"> 
        <h3 class="h3">Major Objectives:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">To select, acquire, organize, and 
            maintain resource materials in support of the Africana Studies and 
            Research Center academic program </font></li>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">To provide bibliographic access to 
            these resources and to those of other Cornell University Library units, 
            and to African, African American, and Caribbean Studies material where 
            ever available through use of printed resources and computerized online 
            retrieval services </font></li>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">To provide informational and reference 
            services to assist library users in finding information and in using 
            resources </font></li>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">To provide adequate facilities for 
            research and study. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="h3"><font size="2">Collecting Levels:</font></h3>
        <p class="content"><font size="2"> Collections of the Africana Library 
          shall be adequate to support the course work of Africana Studies and 
          Research Center advanced undergraduate and master's degree programs, 
          or sustained independent study. The collections will include a wide 
          range of basic monographs both current and retrospective, complete collections 
          of the works of important writers, some highly selective research materials 
          to complement and supplement, but not supplant, the research collections 
          of the University Library, a selection of representative journals, and 
          the reference tools and fundamental bibliographical apparatus pertaining 
          to Africana Studies.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="2">Collecting Areas:</font></h3>
        <p class="content"><font size="2"> Collecting areas of the Africana Library 
          will include materials written by or about peoples of African descent 
          with emphasis on the subject areas of history, literature, politics, 
          economics, sociology, psychology, cultural anthropology and folklore, 
          religion, education, international relations and Third World political 
          economy. In order of importance, the regional emphases of the collection 
          will be first, on materials pertaining to peoples of African descent 
          in the Americas (particularly the United States); second, on Africa; 
          and third on the Caribbean archipelago (including Belize, Guyana, Suriname 
          and French Guiana), with primary emphasis on the Anglophone countries 
          and English language titles for the remainder.</font></p>
        <p class="content"><font size="2"><br>
          <i>Types and Forms of Material Collected:</i><br>
          </font></p>
        <h3><font size="2">Books</font></h3>
        <font size="2"> Generally one copy of a title will be purchased, although 
        in a limited number of instances two or more copies might be acquired. 
        Examples of the latter case are: books about such major personalities 
        as W.E.B. Du Bois or supplementary reserve readings for large classes. 
        The formula to be followed in case of the reserve readings is one copy 
        of a book for every fifteen students in a particular course. Preference 
        will be given to paperback editions rather than hardback editions. Hardback 
        will be acquired only if the paperback edition is unavailable, or if the 
        title was published only in hardback. The criteria for including a title 
        in the collection will be as follows:</p> </font>
        <ul>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">Recognized classics in all fields 
            of African, African American and African Caribbean Studies, both historical 
            and modern, comprising as a minimum the collected works of all standard 
            authors as determined by faculty recommendations, mention in critical 
            works, or inclusion in recognized bibliographies in the above mentioned 
            fields. </font>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">Scholarly merit, including: currency, 
            comprehensiveness and quality of treatment, clarity of presentation, 
            convenience of the arrangement of the material, availability and quality 
            of notes and bibliography, as well as, in general, those books showing 
            evidence of being standard works in their fields, by a standard author 
            in that field, or by a standard publisher in that field. The latter 
            may include large commercial presses, university presses, small publishers, 
            and associations or research organizations. </font>
          <li class="content"><font size="2"> The Africana Library will try to 
            review for purchase at least one copy of every title included in reserve 
            lists which it does not yet own. </font>
          <li class="content"><font size="2"> Serious consideration will be given 
            to any other individual recommendations by faculty, students, or staff 
            for titles about the Black experience falling outside the categories 
            normally collected by the Africana Library. </font>
        </ul>
        <h3><font size="2">Periodicals</font></h3>
        <font size="2"> It is well beyond the capacity of the Africana Library 
        to maintain a comprehensive collection of periodicals in its areas of 
        coverage. It will therefore limit itself to a comparatively small number 
        of titles which are either of fundamental importance or are not being 
        received by any other Cornell library. Most of these will be in English. 
        In most cases a current subscription is maintained and in some cases limited 
        runs. The library will not attempt to complete back runs by purchase in 
        hard copy, but might do so in microform. Back runs in hard copy that are 
        received as gifts might be retained as space permits. Generally only titles 
        covered by one or more indexing service held by the Africana Library will 
        be retained. 
        <h3 class="h3">Monographic Series</h3>
        The Africana Library subscribes to a small number of annuals and monographic 
        series. Most of these are reference materials. 
        <h3 class="h3">Newspapers</h3>
        A small number of current newspapers will be collected. With few exceptions, 
        new back issues will be kept for two years; after which time they will 
        be selectively clipped for the Library's ciippings file. The library will 
        retain back files of newspapers on microform. 
        <h3 class="h3">Reference Books</h3>
        Reference books such as handbooks, dictionaries, encyclopedias, directories, 
        periodical indexes and abstracting services, subject and personal bibliography, 
        and catalogs of major collections in fields the Library collects in will 
        be acquired as needed. The Africana Library aims for self sufficiency 
        in carrying out its mission to be a bibliographic center capable of identifying 
        and locating resources and information pertinent to the areas it collects 
        in. 
        <h3 class="h3">Government Documents</h3>
        The Africana Library will not acquire systematically the publications 
        of any government or international organization. However, individual titles 
        will be acquired as needed and appropriate. 
        <h3 class="h3">Association Publications</h3>
        Current proceedings, papers and reports of major associations or research 
        organizations pertaining to peoples of African descent will be acquired 
        selectively as needed and appropriate. 
        <h3 class="h3">Dissertations</h3>
        The Library will acquire selective dissertations to provide resource materials 
        in collecting areas for which commercial publication is sparse, and as 
        requested by individual faculty and graduate students. 
        <h3 class="h3">Manuscript Collections</h3>
        Manuscript collections on microform for the Civil Rights and Black Power 
        phases of the contemporary African American social movement will be acquired 
        by the Library as funding permits. In addition, paper copy of original 
        primary sources of this era will be actively pursued in collaboration 
        with the faculty of the Africana Studies and Research Center. 
        <h3 class="h3">Science and Technology</h3>
        Except for geographical and topical atlases or maps, and monographs dealing 
        with the broader social, political and economic ramifications of science 
        and technology, the Library will not collect in this area. 
        <h3 class="h3">Music and Art</h3>
        The Africana Library will collect minimally in these areas as such material 
        is properly within the collecting scope of Cornell's Fine Arts and Music 
        libraries. Only a small collection of important monographs, reference 
        works and periodicals will be established here. 
        <h3 class="h3">Law</h3>
        The primary area of emphasis regarding legal materials for the Africana 
        Library will be in the area of civil and human rights. 
        <h3 class="h3">Foreign Language Materials</h3>
        The Africana Library will collect some monographs in support of Swahili 
        language courses offered by the Africana Studies and Research Center. 
        However, its will normally limit its collection activities to English 
        language titles. 
        <h3 class="h3">Weeding</h3>
        To maintain the collection on the highest possible level of quality and 
        suitability, the collection will be weeded on an ongoing basis. Criteria 
        for withdrawing a volume are as follows: <br></p>
        </font>
        <ul>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">its contents no longer meet the selection 
            criteria <br>
            availability of other and better titles on the subject in the Africana 
            Library </font></li>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">its circulation record in the past 
            5 or 10 years reflects infrequent demand </font></li>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">duplicate copies of the title are 
            available elsewhere in the University Library, or </font></li>
          <li class="content"><font size="2">the number of copies in the Africana 
            Library exceeds perceived need. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="h3"><font size="2">Replacement</font></h3>
        <font size="2"> In general, it is the policy of the Africana Library to 
        purchase replacements for volumes discovered to be missing. Most volumes 
        are missing because they were either stolen or properly checked out but 
        not returned. In either case there is clear evidence of demand and these 
        volumes should therefore be maintained in the collection. Missing books 
        are not replaced automatically, but a decision to replace is made on a 
        title by title basis.</p> </font></div>
