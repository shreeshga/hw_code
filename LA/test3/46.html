      <h2 align="center" class="h3">The Library in the Life of Black People</h2>
	  <div id="content">

        <h3 align="center" class="h3">James Turner, Director<br>
          Africana Studies &amp; Research Center<br>
          Date: January, 1973</h3>

        <p><font size="2">One of the most important references or indicators used 
          to assess the quality of institutions for college education, after the 
          quality of the faculty, is the size of the library. The library is an 
          indivisible factor in the equation determining the pride, prestige, 
          and success of most colleges and universities in this country. But libraries 
          seldom receive the second honored position when it comes to making financial 
          appropriations. In these matters libraries are treated as if they are 
          only marginally important to the quality of learning a student receives. 
          At more than a few institutions the student union center is almost comparable 
          in size and cost to the best library facility on campus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Nowhere is the status of libraries more tragic than 
          on many campuses of Black colleges, and it is even worse in terms of 
          public libraries in Black communities. Libraries are heavily dependent 
          upon donation/gifts and grants from very rich individuals and foundations. 
          There is comparatively less government subsidy available than there 
          is for student dormitories, classroom buildings, research laboratories, 
          etc. Needless to say the great foundations in America are white institutions, 
          and so are the people who are wealthy contributors to the great libraries 
          in this country; few of them are concerned with providing outstanding 
          reference and reading collections for the scholarly development of Black 
          people. Even when Black schools receive such support the funds are meager 
          in comparison to the resources made available to comparable white institutions. 
          There are many Black communities which do not even have a public library 
          in the immediate neighborhood.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">However, as in all other spheres of Black life, we must 
          struggle to break the syndrome of dependency related to our important 
          needs and vital provisions for our welfare. The pattern of looking to 
          others to do for us, and then perpetually bemoaning the neglect of us 
          by those whom we look to as the custodians of our possibilities in life, 
          has and continues to ruin our development and self-control as a people. 
          There are many in our community who can afford to assume a greater responsibility 
          for the development and maintenance of library resources available for 
          the education of our people. The fundamentality of our Blackness is 
          a reality and commitment that cannot be ignored. Ultimately our reliance 
          must be on ourselves and each other.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The creation of the library at the Africana Studies 
          &amp; Research Center was perceived as an inextricable component of 
          the program from its inception. Our goal is to develop a specialized 
          collection concentrating on the history, culture and life-conditions 
          of African people which will serve as a valuable complement for our 
          students and faculty. Its establishment is of both symbolic and concrete 
          significance. The Africana library provides a model of quality standards, 
          and an example to other programs to take more seriously the relationship 
          of a viable Black library collection to their success. The existence 
          of the library will expose students to the knowledge of a rich Black 
          legacy of scholarships, and creative/cultural tradition. Though we have 
          serious constraints in terms of limited financial resources, we are 
          dedicated to the importance of library collections focusing on African 
          people, and controlled by Black people. Our library is provided principally 
          for our students, since its ultimate value is in its maximum use.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It is a general truism that Black people need more and 
          better library facilities wherever they are. Therefore, our basic point 
          is that a commitment to support the expansion of African/African American 
          library collections is a good investment in our people, particularly 
          our students. Libraries are vital links in the history of all people; 
          they appreciate in value over time, and are always a source of relevance 
          and reference in the education of future generations. If it is true 
          that wisdom is garnered from experience, then the serious study of African 
          people will reveal much of the substance of future wisdom. The Africana 
          Studies and Research Center Library is devoted to inspiring young, Black 
          men and women to assume professional careers as Black teachers and research 
          scholars.</font><br>
